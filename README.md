## Goals

Build the Snake game which would work smoothly with various fun features and should be user engaging.

## Logic

 - Snake should move in four directions.
 - Snake should be able to eat fruit.
 - Score ( by 1 ) and speed increases as it eats the fruit.
 - Reward after every 10 points
 - If it eats reward, score increases and length decreases by 3.
 - Should have two modes, arcade and classic.
 - In arcade, snake dies if touches boundaries whereas in classic, it can move though the walls.
 - Highest Score should be stored for both modes.
 - User should be able to sign up and sign in.
 - Showing the Leaderboard.
